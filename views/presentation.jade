    h3 Problem
    ul
      li Hardware
      p We believe that the technical development of smartphones has stagnated. Building faster processors, having more CPU cores and bigger screens with higher resolution does not give you an competitive advantage any longer. All manufacturers can do this. You can no longer compete with a technical specification to win the smartphone customer of tomorrow.
      li Software
      p Google has already invested billions in developing Android. On top of this, google has some of the world's best UX-designers. Yet, manufacturers still try to differentiate by creating custom functions and skins. The problem with this is that it involves enormous development costs of something that is already free, finished and great to use.
      li User Experience
      p The trend of today's hardware and software developments is leading to a worse user experience. The innovation that the manufacturers are doing is not user driven, it is a demonstration of what manufacturers can do technically ignoring what the user benefits from.

    h3 Solution
    ul
      li Focus 
      p Manufacturers are not focusing on what they do best. Focusing on your core competence will give you a competitive advantage but instead they are trying to be software, hardware and design companies all at once.
      li Competitive advantage
      p Bäcke will compete with competitive advantages like brand value, design, material and user friendliness. All this will be more important when choosing a new smartphone.
      li A new breed
      p By taking the smartphone from its technology oriented context and instead promote it as a lifestyle product, we create a new product that better meets the modern customer's idea of what a smartphone is.

    h3 Proof
    ul
      li Maturity
      p Many products have gone through the same lifecycle. Take headphones as an example. Just a few years ago the market was dominated by only a few traditional manufacturers. But when innovation in headphone technology stagnated other companies took market shares by profiling the earpiece as a lifestyle product. 
      li Media
      p This is also echoed in media: 
        a(href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/27/8666861/smartphone-design-stagnation" target="_blank") “They are all too damn good nowadays for a new one to arrive and wow us with its excellence. But surely that makes design even more important, not less. If everyone can tout the same specs and capabilities, it will be the devices that just feels better that will win people over”

    h3 Customers 
    ul
      li Core users 
      p These are 25-35 year old hip urban people. A group of customers who are affluent or middle class, young Bohemians, who reside in gentrifying neighborhoods. This group already has a strong foothold in Sweden and overseas. 
      li Early adopters
      p These customers buy our products because they want to try something new. They have already tried the iPhone and are tired of today's Android products. They are not loyal and does not embody our brand like our core users. It's that teenager who tells mom and dad what to buy.
      li mass market
      p This customer group possesses no precise characteristic except that they represent the masses. They are the group of customers that makes us a household world brand.

    h3 Markets 
    ul
      li Sweden
      p Sweden is our first market. Sweden is known for being a trial market with a demanding and tech savvy population. Our intention for BÄCKE is to become an international brand which means that we will not stop here. Sweden will however be important from a brand building point of view.
      li Asia
      p Our customers are located throughout the world, but the strategy to achieve them will go through Sweden to then focus on the Asian market. Here, China is a crucial market. We will reach these customers with the help of our Scandinavian brand and design.
      li Europe & US
      p Are important markets but will be prioritized at a later stage.
